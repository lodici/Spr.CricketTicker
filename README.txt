==================
SPR Cricket Ticker
==================

ABOUT
=====
I wrote this because I wanted a simple way of keeping track of the cricket score without having to flick back and forth between my browser and whatever I was currently working on. The result is a simple, unobtrusive ticker which takes up very little screen real estate.


USER INSTRUCTIONS
=================
When started, SPR Cricket Ticker displays a list of active and upcoming international cricket matches.
Double-clicking an entry in the list will either -
  - create a ticker if the selected game is active
    - games usually become active within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time.
  - display additional details if the game is upcoming but not yet 'in play'.
The ticker is always on top and can be dragged about the screen.
Hover your mouse over the ticker for more details about the match.
The ticker is updated every 30 seconds.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Should an unexpected error occur then the ticker will display a suitable message and you will have to restart. Error information is logged to 'Spr.CricketTicker.log' which can be found in the installation directory. It would be really helpful if you could raise a ticket at https://sourceforge.net/p/sprcrickettickr/tickets/ and attach this log file. Thanks.
